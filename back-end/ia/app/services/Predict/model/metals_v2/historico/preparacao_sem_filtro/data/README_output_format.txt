Time was reported by the data provider.



===== DATA DELIVERED ==========================================================

The data delivery consists of a Microsoft-Excel-file (parameter_request.xls)
containing a number of worksheets:
    
    1) A worksheet with station metadata (named Station_Metadata), containing 
       details on the stations that had data available for the specific request.

    2) A worksheet with parameter metadata (named Parameter_Metadata),  
       containing a description of the requested water quality parameters.
    
    3) A worksheet with analysis methods metadata (named Methods_Metadata), 
       containing a description of the methods used for analysis of the water 
       samples.
